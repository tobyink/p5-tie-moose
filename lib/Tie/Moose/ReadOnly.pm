=head1 NAME

Tie::Moose::ReadOnly - make tied hash read-only

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	tie my %bob, "Tie::Moose"->with_traits("ReadOnly"), $bob;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This trait makes the tied hash read-only, even if the underlying object's
attributes are read-write.

Attempts to store to or delete from the hash will throw an error.
