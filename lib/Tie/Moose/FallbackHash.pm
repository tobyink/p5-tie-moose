=head1 NAME

Tie::Moose::FallbackHash - provide a fallback hashref for unknown attributes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my %data;
	tie(
		my %bob,
		"Tie::Moose"->with_traits("FallbackHash"),
		$bob, fallback => \%data,
	);
	
	$bob{xyz} = 123;   # $bob doesn't have an attribute called "xyz"
	say $data{xyz};    # ... so this gets stored in the fallback hash

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Usually if you try to store data against a hash key which does not have a
corresponding attribute in the underlying Moose object, L<Tie::Moose> will
throw an exception. This module allows you to instead store it into a
fallback hash.

The fallback hash can itself be a tied hash, or an object which overloads
C<< %{} >>, so this allows for some interesting possibilities.
